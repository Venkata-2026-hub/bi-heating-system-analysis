Business Intelligence academic project analysing heating system operating modes using Tableau, SQL, and predictive analytics.
# Business Intelligence – Heating System Mode Analysis

## Overview
Academic Business Intelligence project completed as part of the MSc in Business Information Systems at FHNW.
The project analyses real-world building sensor data to identify and classify heating system operating modes,
supporting energy efficiency analysis and data-driven decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Building heating systems generate large volumes of sensor data, but operating modes are often monitored
manually. This project aims to automate the identification of heating modes and detect anomalies using
data analytics and predictive models.

## Objectives
- Analyse heating system behaviour using sensor data
- Identify operating modes and seasonal patterns
- Detect anomalies and manual overrides
- Support sustainability and energy efficiency goals

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau – dashboards and visualisation
- SQL – data extraction, transformation, and preparation
- Orange Data Mining – classification models and evaluation
- Predictive analytics and KPI design

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- KPI definition and metric design
- Interactive dashboard development
- Classification models and performance evaluation
- Model validation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Outcomes
- Interactive Tableau dashboards for system monitoring
- Validated predictive models for operating mode classification
- Actionable insights to reduce manual monitoring effort
